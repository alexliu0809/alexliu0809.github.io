[8 Linux Nslookup Commands](https://www.tecmint.com/8-linux-nslookup-commands-to-troubleshoot-dns-domain-name-server/)

## NSLookUp
Nslookup is a command-line tool to obtain domain names or IP addresses mapping, or other specific DNS Records. The name "nslookup" means "name server lookup".

### Find the A record of Ð° domain
The ip address for **yahoo.com** is **98.137.246.8**. You are querying the DNS server **2607:f720:100:100::230**. If you can't load a website by typing its ip, look at [this article](https://superuser.com/questions/1361680/cant-access-website-by-ip-but-i-can-access-by-fully-qualified-domain)
```bash
$ nslookup -type=a yahoo.com
Server:		2607:f720:100:100::230
Address:	2607:f720:100:100::230#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	yahoo.com
Address: 98.137.246.8
Name:	yahoo.com
Address: 72.30.35.10
Name:	yahoo.com
Address: 98.138.219.231
Name:	yahoo.com
Address: 98.138.219.232
Name:	yahoo.com
Address: 72.30.35.9
Name:	yahoo.com
Address: 98.137.246.7
```

### Reverse DNS Lookup
Reverse DNS lookups for IPv4 addresses use the special domain **in-addr.arpa**.
```bash
$ nslookup 98.137.246.8
Server:		2607:f720:100:100::230
Address:	2607:f720:100:100::230#53

Non-authoritative answer:
8.246.137.98.in-addr.arpa	name = media-router-fp2.prod1.media.vip.gq1.yahoo.com.

Authoritative answers can be found from:
246.137.98.in-addr.arpa	nameserver = ns2.yahoo.com.
246.137.98.in-addr.arpa	nameserver = ns3.yahoo.com.
246.137.98.in-addr.arpa	nameserver = ns1.yahoo.com.
246.137.98.in-addr.arpa	nameserver = ns5.yahoo.com.
246.137.98.in-addr.arpa	nameserver = ns4.yahoo.com.
ns1.yahoo.com	has AAAA address 2001:4998:130::1001
ns2.yahoo.com	has AAAA address 2001:4998:140::1002
ns3.yahoo.com	has AAAA address 2406:8600:f03f:1f8::1003
ns5.yahoo.com	has AAAA address 2406:2000:ff60::53
ns1.yahoo.com	internet address = 68.180.131.16
ns2.yahoo.com	internet address = 68.142.255.16
ns3.yahoo.com	internet address = 27.123.42.42
ns4.yahoo.com	internet address = 98.138.11.157
ns5.yahoo.com	internet address = 202.165.97.53
```


### Find the NS records of a domain
The name server address for **yahoo.com** is **ns3.yahoo.com**. You are querying the DNS server **2607:f720:100:100::230**.
```bash
$ nslookup -type=ns yahoo.com
Server:		2607:f720:100:100::230
Address:	2607:f720:100:100::230#53

Non-authoritative answer:
yahoo.com	nameserver = ns3.yahoo.com.
yahoo.com	nameserver = ns5.yahoo.com.
yahoo.com	nameserver = ns4.yahoo.com.
yahoo.com	nameserver = ns1.yahoo.com.
yahoo.com	nameserver = ns2.yahoo.com.

Authoritative answers can be found from:
ns1.yahoo.com	has AAAA address 2001:4998:130::1001
ns2.yahoo.com	has AAAA address 2001:4998:140::1002
ns3.yahoo.com	has AAAA address 2406:8600:f03f:1f8::1003
ns5.yahoo.com	has AAAA address 2406:2000:ff60::53
ns1.yahoo.com	internet address = 68.180.131.16
ns2.yahoo.com	internet address = 68.142.255.16
ns3.yahoo.com	internet address = 27.123.42.42
ns4.yahoo.com	internet address = 98.138.11.157
ns5.yahoo.com	internet address = 202.165.97.53
```

## Traceroute
traceroute command prints the route that a packet takes to reach the host. This command is useful when you want to know about the route and about all the hops that a packet takes. If seeing **\*\*\*** in traceroute, it means that a packet is not acknowledged within the expected timeout.
### Basic Usage
```
$ traceroute googl.com
traceroute to googl.com (172.217.11.164), 64 hops max, 52 byte packets
