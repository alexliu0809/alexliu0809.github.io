					<h5>Project Introduction</h5>
					<p align="justify">A Board Game AI is a computer program developed to play certain the board games, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect6" style="color:lightgreen">Connect6</a>. I was involved in developing several AI programs, including a Connect6 AI, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect6" style="color:lightgreen">Game of Amazons</a> AI, etc.. Our team took over the Connect6 AI from previous students and continued to work on it. The Connect6 AI was awarded the 1st place in the Chinese University Computer Games Championship in 2014. The Amazons AI was awarded the 1st prize.

					<h5>Key Features</h5>
					<ul class="details-list">
						<li>
							In search module, to speed up the alpha-beta search, we adopt techniques such as history heuristic, killer heuristic, hash table, multi-thread calculation, etc..
						</li>
						
						<li>
							 A simple pattern recognition is implemented for special search patterns.
						</li>
						<li>
							 Dynamic search depth adaptation to balance performance and time.
						</li>

						<li>
							 Combined two ways of evaluating a game borad -- one using <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397505005979" style="color:lightgreen">static method</a>, one using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCTS" style="color:lightgreen">Monte Carlo Tree Search</a>.
						</li>
						
						<li>
							A pre-calculated opening book is used to try and gain an advantage out of the opening.
