author: Enze "Alex" Liu
author_bio: Hi, my name is Enze (pronounced like the italian name Enzo) Liu. I also use the English name "Alex". I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at UC San Diego advised by Stefan Savage and Geoffrey Voelker. I am broadly interested in computer security and privacy. My current research focuses on using large-scale empirical analyses to help improve cybersecurity. Previously, I did some research on passwords with Blase Ur and David Cash at the University of Chicago.
